**Please read before using the evaluation code:**  
The evaluation pipeline does not keep track of sentence tokenization, which may result in lower-than-expected ROUGE-L scores, and that the newsroom-run -> newsroom-score -> newsroom-tables evaluation pipeline should not be used for publishable evaluation. Please see: https://github.com/lil-lab/newsroom/issues/28
